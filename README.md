## Overview

Firewall Manager is a web-based tool for managing firewall rule requests. It enables you to:

- **Create** new firewall rule requests.
- **Review** and **approve/reject** pending requests.
- **Install** approved rules directly to your firewall (after proper backend configuration).

The screenshot above shows the intuitive dashboard where administrators can filter and review rule requests.

## Features

- **User-friendly Dashboard:**  
  Easily filter and search requests by status, IP addresses, ports, or requester names.

- **Role-Based Access:**  
  Administrators can review, approve/reject, and install rules, while regular users can submit requests.

- **Customizable Firewall Integration:**  
  Integrate with your specific firewall by modifying the backend logic in `install.js`.

---

## Important Notes

1. **DEVMODE:**  
   - Developer mode is enabled by default for local development and debugging.
   - **For production, disable DEVMODE** by setting `DEVMODE=false` via environment variables.

2. **Firewall Integration:**  
   - To connect to your firewall API, configure the backend file **`install.js`** with the appropriate commands and API calls matching your firewall's requirements.

3. **License & Usage:**  
   - This project is open source for personal and non-commercial use only.
   - **Business or commercial use is prohibited** without an explicit agreement with the author.

## Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file in your backend directory with the following variables:

```ini
PORT=3001
JWT_SECRET=your_secret_key
LDAP_URL=ldap://ldap.example.org
LDAP_BASE_DN=DC=example,DC=org
LDAP_DOMAIN_SUFFIX=@example.org
LDAP_ADMIN_GROUP=GROUPNAMEXAMPLE
DEVMODE=true
```

These variables control the server port, JWT token secret, LDAP configuration, and the developer mode status. Remember to disable DEVMODE for production.

Getting Started
